## About Project
- Exploratory data analysis and visualizations were conducted over the [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritwikb3/heart-disease-cleveland) and various machine learning models were trained over the same. 
- Additionally, a KNN model was deployed into a web app made using HTML, CSS and Flask, which allows users to check the risk of heart disease based on their medical info.
- Python's Pickle module was used to deploy the KNN model into the web-app.
